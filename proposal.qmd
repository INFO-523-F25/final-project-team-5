A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.


The Daily Stocks Data dataset (stocks_data.csv) is a dataset from Kaggle which captures data on financial market performance from 1990 to 2024. This data has relevant 
information related to volume, macroeconomic indicators, volatility index, and uncertainty metrics. This dataset is compiled from a variety of historical records, 
including the Chicago Board Option Exchange, Yahoo Finance and historical finance datasets, Buerau of Economic Anaysis, Federal Reserve, Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, 
and the Global Policy Uncertainty Database.

The dataset has the following dimensions:
  1. dt: Observation Date
  2. vix: Volatility Index (VIX)
  3. sp500: S&P 500 Index Value
  4. sp500_volume: Daily trading volume for the S&P 500.
  5. djia: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
  6. djia_volume: Daily trading volume for the DJIA.
  7. hsi: Hang Seng Index
  8. ads: Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti (ADS) Business Conditions Index
  9. us3m: U.S. Treasury 3-month bond yield
  10. joblessness: U.S. unemployment rate, reported as quartiles.
  11. epu: Economic Policy Uncertainty Index
  12. GPRD: Geopolitical Risk Index (Daily)
  13. prev_day: Previous dayâ€™s S&P 500 closing value

We ultimately chose this dataset as a team because we wanted to analyze the stock market. Furthermore, this particular dataset had very reliable sources along with being
a clean, complete set of data, so we knew that this was a trustworthy dataset that would be ready for analysis.


## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

1. How do economic factors (i.e. unemployment rates, U.S. Treasurey 3-Month Bond Yield, etc.) impact volatility within the financial markets?
2. What insights can historical stock market data offer to forecast future price movements and assess market volatility?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).

1. For this question, we plan to analyze the impact on volatility rates with features related to the economy, inlcuding Unemployment Rate, 
U.S. Treasure 3-Month Bond Yield rate, Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, and Geopolitical Risk Index in order to determine how these economic factors impact
the financial markets.
2. For this question we plan to analyze long-term trends focusing on monthly and yearly patterns using the date variable. By examining aggregated data across these longer intervals, we can identify consistent patterns that can show us how long-term market movements influence future price forecasts and volatility levels.
