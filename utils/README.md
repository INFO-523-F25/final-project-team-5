## Util Module

This folder contains **utility Python modules** that support the main notebook in this project.  
The goal is to keep our notebook **simple, readable, and maintainable** by moving helper functions and reusable logic into organized scripts.


## Folder Purpose

The `utils/` directory acts as a lightweight **library** for your project.  
Each `.py` file inside this folder focuses on a specific task or logical component of your workflow — for example, data preprocessing, visualization, or model evaluation.
